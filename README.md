To anyone coming here to **clone this bot**, no support will be given for it. If you PM me on Telegram will be ignored.

Hitsuki is a bot developed with python3 with a sqalchemy database, Hitsuki uses PTB (python-telegram-bot), pyrogram and telethon, Hitsuki uses Telethon and Pyrogram in specific modules but was initially designed only with PTB.

Originally being a [Haruka Aya](https://gitlab.com/HarukaNetwork/HarukaAya) fork with some improvements. Currently Hitsuki focuses on efficiency for Android groups and anime groups, being complete enough for group management.

Can be found on telegram as [Hitsuki](https://t.me/LordHitsuki_BOT), you can also join [Hitsuki's News](https://t.me/HitsukiNews) channel.
