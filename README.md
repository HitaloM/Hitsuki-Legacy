# Hitsuki
----------

A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming 
a basis for modular bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

Can be found as [Hitsuki](https://t.me/LordHitsukiBETA_BOT) on Telegram.

Based on [Emilia Hikari](https://github.com/AyraHikari/EmiliaHikari)
